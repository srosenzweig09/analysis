## 1. Preparing conda environment

1. Download [miniconda3 (Linux-x86-64](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh) to your favorite remote workspace. From the command line you can run: <br>
 ```wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh```
2. Run miniconda installer using command<br> `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` <br> **Note:** You may need to specify where to install. For instance, I work in EOS storage area accessed through LXPLUS so I must specify to save installation and environments in `/eos/user/s/srosenzw/`
3. Create a conda environment ([documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)) using<br> `conda create --name sixb` or use the base environment `conda activate base`
4. Some packages will require included a new source<br> `conda config --append channels conda-forge` 
5. Install the packages contained in `sixb-spec.txt` using the command<br>
 ```conda create --name sixb --file spec-file.txt```
 6. Recommended: Clone and add modules/ to your python path using<br> `conda develop modules`

## 3. Generating features
A machine learning model learns the relationship between a set of features and their target output. Naturally, the first step to developing a model is to generate the features.

Location: ```ml/inputs/generate_features.py```<br>
Command Line Arguments:<br>
```--task```  Description: What kind of neural network? (classifier, regressor)<br>
```--type```  Description: What kind of sample? (reco, parton, smeared)<br>
```--run```  &nbsp;&nbsp;Description: Index of training session (*integer*) <br>
              
 ## 4. Training the neural network
Neural networks are trained using ```nntrainer.py``` in the ```scripts/``` directory.
